        "description" : ["Just Read the Instructions (JRTI) is an autonomous spaceport droneship (ASDS). JRTI is a modified barge that is outfitted with a large landing platform, station-keeping thrusters, and other equipment to allow SpaceX to land boosters at sea on high-velocity missions that don’t carry enough fuel to allow for a return-to-launch-site landing.", "Just Read the Instructions was originally based in California to support missions launching from Vandenburg Air Force Base. The droneship was moved to Florida in late 2019 to support the increasing number of missions launching from Cape Canaveral.", "Just Read the Instructions is the second SpaceX droneship to use the name. The original SpaceX droneship, operated for two experimental landings in the Atlantic Ocean in early 2015, used the same name but was retired and replaced by Of Course I Still Love You droneship in June 2015. The JRTI name was then given to the new droneship operating from California.", "JRTI was built in a Louisiana shipyard, alongside the other SpaceX droneship Of Course I Still Love You. To reach its new home in California the ship had to pass through the Panama Canal. The droneship was too wide to fit through the canal locks so the extra wing extensions – designed to provide a larger landing pad – had to be placed on deck to be installed upon arrival in California.", "Just Read the Instructions is out-fitted in a similar fashion to Of Course I Still Love You. Four azimuth thruster engines give the droneship the capability to maintain position at sea to within 3 meters using GPS. Cameras and sensors record the landings for analysis and a series of antennas up-link this data to a satellite and allow for communication with the incoming booster. Data up-link often cuts out at the moment of landing because heavy vibrations from the landing shake the antennas out of their lock with the satellite. This video explains more.", "SpaceX droneships are not designed to autonomously move themselves over long distances. Instead, a tugboat is used to tow the droneship to the target position offshore in the ocean. The exact position of the droneship is dependant on mission requirements.", "JRTI and the tugboat will leave Port Canaveral up to 7 days in advance of the launch date, with other accompanying support ships leaving later. After traveling to the landing zone the thrusters and other equipment required for the landing will be activated. Support vessels and the tugboat will then retreat to a safe distance to observe the landing. Just Read the Instructions is unmanned during all landings.", "Once the landing is complete, the Octagrabber robot will be deployed to secure the booster and SpaceX technicians will disengage the thrusters and prepare the droneship for the return journey. The tugboat will then tow JRTI back to port.", "Just Read the Instructions was towed away from Los Angeles, California, on August 1st, 2019 – destined for Morgan City, Louisiana. The droneship passed through the Panama Canal on August 18th. Because of the limited width of the Panama Canal locks, the wing extensions of Just Read the Instructions had to be cut off and placed on the deck for the transit.", "Just Read the Instructions arrived at Morgan City on August 27th, 2019, and was berthed at LAD Services of Berwick. The ship spent about 4 months there whilst the side wings were reinstalled and the barge received a general refurbishment. JRTI was then towed to Port Canaveral, Florida – arriving on December 11th, 2019. A large amount of equipment was loaded onto the droneship for the journey to Florida – the equipment was later installed onto the droneship for the upgrade.", "Between January and May 2020, SpaceX technicians worked to upgraded the JRTI for service in the Atlantic Ocean. The old azimuth retractable thrusters were replaced with electrically-driven fixed thrusters that remain permanently submerged underwater.", "To power the new thrusters, six diesel generators were installed alongside other supporting equipment. Just Read the Instructions also gained an Octagrabber robot, something it did not have during Pacific Ocean operations."],

When deployed, they allow the droneship to maintain a precise position whilst at sea. Elon Musk has stated that the droneship is capable of maintaining its target position to within 3 meters, even under storm conditions. The droneship can reportedly maintain its target position autonomously, or under remote control by operators on a support ship.", "The droneship is fitted with cameras, sensors and other measuring equipment to allow SpaceX to record and gather data on the landings. On a number of occasions, it has been shown that the cameras can be remotely adjusted and moved during landings to provide a better perspective.", "Of Course I Still Love You is fitted with two satellite antennas for the uplink of data and for communication with the incoming booster. A common problem experienced during SpaceX webcasts is the video connection to the droneship cutting out during the landing. This occurs because vibrations created by the landing booster violently shake the droneship, temporarily breaking the connection and up-link to the satellite. This video explains more.", "A robot, officially named the Falcon 9 Securing Robot, but universally known as Octagrabber lives on the droneship and is deployed shortly after a booster landing. The robot is remotely driven from its blast-proof shelter and positioned underneath the Falcon 9. Four arms then raise up and latch onto the Falcon 9 octaweb, securing the booster for transit.", "OCISLY is equipped with remotely-operated firefighting hoses that can quickly deluge the droneship in water in the event of an explosion or fire caused by a failed landing.", "SpaceX droneships are not designed to autonomously move themselves over long distances. Instead, a tugboat is used to tow the droneship to the target position offshore in the Atlantic Ocean. The exact position of the droneship is dependant on mission requirements.", "Boosters used on Starlink and geostationary transfer orbit missions typically land between 600 – 675 km downrange. The furthest droneship position was 1239 km downrange, set during the STP-2 Falcon Heavy mission in June 2019.", "OCISLY and the tugboat will leave port up to 7 days in advance of the launch date, with other accompanying support ships leaving later. After traveling to the landing zone the thrusters and other equipment will be engaged. Support vessels and the tugboat will then retreat to a safe distance to observe the landing. Of Course I Still Love You is unmanned during all landings.", "Once the landing is complete, Octagrabber will be deployed to secure the booster and SpaceX technicians will dis-engage the thrusters and prepare the droneship for the return journey. The tugboat will then tow OCISLY back to port.", "SpaceX repositioned Of Course I Still Love You from Port Canaveral, Florida, to the Port of Long Beach, California in June 2021.", "Just Read the Instructions droneship was previously based in California until mid-2019 but was repositioned to Florida as launched out of Vandenberg slowed down. This meant that SpaceX no longer had a dronship to support Pacific Ocean operations.", "SpaceX then seemed to switch plans and reactivated the Vandeberg launch site to support the Starlink constellation. SpaceX chose to move OCISLY to the Pacific Ocean and replaced it with A Shortfall of Gravitas on the East Coast.", "OCISLY droneship was loaded onto heavy-lift ship Mighty Servant 1 in the Bahamas and carried all the way through the Panama Canal to Long Beach where it was unloaded."],

To do this, the Adele Elise backs its stern up to the droneship. Next, recovery teams connect themselves up with harnesses and then climb onto the droneship in a process dubbed ‘crew transfer’. For safety reasons, crew transfer does not occur at night or during rough seas."],

        "description" : ["Megan (Previously named GO Searcher) is a Dragon recovery ship used by SpaceX. The vessel is one of two ships configured to recover the capsule after splashdown at the end of a mission or during certain abort scenarios. Megan has been a part of the SpaceX recovery fleet since 2022.", "Megan was renamed from GO Searcher in February 2022 when the vessel was sold to SpaceX by previous owner/operator Guice Offshore (GO). The name is in honor of NASA astronaut Megan McArthur, the second female astronaut that SpaceX flew.", "Megan has been preparing for Dragon recovery operations since early 2018, completing countless hours of training and upgrade works. The vessel had a starring role during the first flight of Crew Dragon, recovering the capsule from the Atlantic Ocean after its week-long stay at the International Space Station.", "The vessel recovered Crew Dragon for a second time during the In-Flight Abort test mission, where SpaceX purposefully destroyed a booster to test that Dragon’s escape system worked as designed.", "During summer 2018, SpaceX upgraded the vessel for Dragon recovery operations. Megan boasts a medical treatment facility, helipad, and extensive communication radars. A large lifting crane is installed on the stern of the vessel to lift the capsule from the water.", "Following splashdown of the capsule, recovery teams in small fast-approach boats connect lines between Megan and Dragon, and then the capsule is carefully lifted from the water. Astronauts would then egress from the capsule once it is secured on the deck of Megan. NASA requires SpaceX to egress astronauts from Dragon within 60 minutes of splashdown.", "When splashdown occurs offshore near Cape Canaveral, astronauts will be recovered and travel back to Port Canaveral on board the recovery ship. In the event of a medical emergency or a splashdown elsewhere, a helicopter will land and transport the astronauts back to land. SpaceX completed a demonstration of a helicopter evacuation for NASA in fall 2018.", "Megan first recovered a Dragon with humans onboard on September 18th, 2021, during the Inspiration4 mission.", "Between April and May 2019 the ship was temporarily re-assigned to fairing recovery operations. Alongside Shannon, the ship was fitted with inflatables and sent to retrieve the fairings during the ArabSat-6A and Starlink 0.9 missions. The ship was successful on both occasions and delivered an intact fairing half back to Port Canaveral upon the conclusion of both missions."],
